# Shakesperean-Monkey-Solo-Attempt
This is my attempt at creating an example of a "Shakesperean monkey" genetic algorithm (inspired by non other than the coding train). No tutorials are followed but online resources have been use, but not for the understanding of the genetic algorithm (eg for syntax errors)
